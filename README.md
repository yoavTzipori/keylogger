Introduction
This Keylogger script allows you to record keystrokes on a computer, and send the log to a specified email address at a given interval. It uses the Python programming language and requires the following modules:
•	smtplib: for sending emails using the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)
•	pynput.keyboard: for listening to keyboard inputs
•	threading: for scheduling functions to run at specified intervals
How to Use
1.Clone the repository or download the Keylogger script.
2.Install the required modules by running pip install pynput
3.Open the Keylogger script in a text editor and specify the time interval, email, and password for sending the log via email.
4.Run the script by typing python main.py in the terminal.

Functionality
The script consists of a Keylogger class that has the following methods:
•	__init__(self, time_interval, email, password): Initializes the log message, time interval, email, and password.
•	append_to_log(self, string): Appends the specified string to the log.
•	process_key_press(self, key): Processes each key press, converting it to a string and appending it to the log.
•	report(self): Sends the log via email and clears the log. This function is scheduled to run at the specified time interval using the Timer function.
•	send_mail(self, email, password, message): Sends an email using the specified email and password.
•	start(self): Starts the keylogger by creating a keyboard listener and scheduling the report function to run at the specified time interval.
Security
